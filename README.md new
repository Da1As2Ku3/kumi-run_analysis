#Course: Getting and Cleaning Data Project

#Objectives of the Project
1.A tidy data set
2.A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3.A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations 
or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4.You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 
This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

#Review of the project:  
The project has been extremely useful as it teaches students how to download files, unzip,
clean, and organize a messy file to a more tidy data file.
In addition, it teaches students how to merge datasets and use the pipe operator.


#Requirements
This project required the installation and loading of some packages and files
to get the work done. Some of the packages include data.table,dplyr etc.
Files include the file downloaded from the web for the analysis and other messy files that 
had to be transformed into a more tidy dataset for analysis.


#Script list
1.library(data.table):This loads the data.table package.
2.library(dplyr):This loads the dplyr package.
3.path:The working directory where the actual work is done.
4.fileurl:The url downloaded for the project. 
5.unzip:This unzips the zipped file to grant access.
6.activityLabels:loads the activity labels in the file.
7.features:loads the features in the file.
8.featuresWanted:extracts the features wanted from the file using grep()function.
9.measurements:extracts the measurements wanted from the file using gsub()function.
10.train:load the train datasets.
11.trainActivities:load the train activities from the train datasets.
12.trainSubjects:load the train subjects from the train datasets.
13.cbind:column binds the trainSubjects,trainActivities and train.
14.test:loads the test datasets.
15.testActivities:load the test activities from the datasets.
16.testSubjects:loads the test subjects from the datasets.
17.cbind:column binds the testSubjects,testActivities and test.
18.mergedDT:merges the train and test datasets.
19:write.table: exports dataframe mergedDT from R to excel in a csv
(comma separated value)format. The excel data is saved as a tidy dataset.
20:Used (as.factor) on mergedDT$SubjectNum and mergedDT$Activity to convert 
SubjectNum and Activity to factors and confirmed the class and levels of the factors created.
21.Used the pipe operator on the mergedDT dataset to group the factors created and then
summarise with respect to the mean.
21:write.table:export dataframe mergedDTFinal from R to a text/csv format to create a second
independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Bottlenecks
Initially I had a few challenges loading the file into R since this was the first time I
am dealing with two zipped files in a single folder that need to be unzipped and then loaded.
I did a few readings here and there and I was able to go around it.
Thanks to my master - Google.
